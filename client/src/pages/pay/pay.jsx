            Quick heads up about RimRubber! Right now, it's all about helping
            buyers connect with sellers. Cool, right? But here's the thing â€“ our
            cart is like a window shopping tool. You can add stuff, but don't
            hit that buy button because we're not set up for payments just yet.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            No worries, though! Iam working on it. Adding a way to pay is on our
            to-do list, but it might take a bit because Iam juggling other
            projects too.
          </p>

            Thanks a bunch for hanging in there and being part of RimRubber! If
            you've got questions or thoughts, hit me up anytime.
